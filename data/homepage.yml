  title: "Something about me"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am a young Engineering student and my path was decided by my passion. I like to complicate my life
    and I can never stop. I am always involved in extra projects to improve my soft skills.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of interest is server management and network design.
    I came to this conclusion over time, after my experience with r00tstici, a students CTF team that I helped to found.
    Security intrigues me and I often do backend development as well.
